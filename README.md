# callback

Callbacks are functions that are called at various stages of the training process, such as the start or end of an epoch, or the start or end of a batch. They allow you to perform actions like:

- Saving model checkpoints
- Stopping training early (EarlyStopping)
- Logging training metrics (TensorBoard)
- Adjusting the learning rate during training (LearningRateScheduler)
